Lasso regression
#Thanks for reading my notebook, i used versite code and technique to fit model,
1-i split the data into two subsets of electric vehicle and conventional vehicles
2-i used lasso regression believing all features are not eqally important
3-i didn't split the electric vehicles data into test-train considering small size of data, only 189 entries.
4-i'm just amazed by the goodness of fit of lasso model, it gave normally distributed residuals with a very steep peak at zero, and all this with out any normalization or regularization.
